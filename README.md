Translating open agricultural research to local language project

Empowering farmers and policy makers with making openly accessible agricultural research in local language.Please checkout our <a href="https://agritrans.github.io">website</a>

**You are warmly welcome!**

Thanks a lot for visiting our projects and you are kindly invited to join this project.

## The Challenge

Currently, the agricultural research outputs are available in English language and in scientific terms which cannot be understood by farmers and the policy makers which motivated us to start this project.

## Our Proposal

This project proposes to translate open research outputs in agriculture into Ethiopian local languages like Amharic, and to communicate scientific terms in plain language that farmers can understand. The translations will be openly available to farmers and the general public using an online platform to facilitate citizen engagement in open science, including data collection and data analysis, with the expectation that citizen involvement will increase agricultural productivity.

## Who are we?
